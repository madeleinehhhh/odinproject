<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What are the eight data types of javascript?
    <ol>
      <li>number</li>
      <li>BigInt -- for numbers bigger than 2^53 - 1. a value is a BigInt if we add n to the end, e.g. 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n</li>
      <li>strings, denoted with simple quotes, single or double, or extended functionality backticks: ', ", `<br />you can embed variables and expressions into a backtick string by putting them in: ${...}.</li>
      <li>boolean</li>
      <li>null -- would be assigned to something with an unknown or undefined value, like if someone hasn't input their age yet</li>
      <li>undefined -- could but shouldn't be assigned to a variable, and is the default initial value until another variable is assigned</li>
      <li>objects -- can store more complex collections of data than the other "primitive" types which contain only a single thing (a string, number, etc.)</li>
      <li>symbols... create unique identifiers for objects... more later</li>
    </ol></li>
  <li>Which data type is NOT primitive?<br />objects (also symbols? i don't think so)</li>
  <li>What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?<br />single & double are simple and backticks have extended functionality, i.e. you can embed variables & expressions in them!</li>
  <li>Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions into a string?<br />the backtick!</li>
  <li>How do you embed variables/expressions into a string?<br />${}</li>
  <li>How do you escape characters in a string?<br />with a back slash: \</li>
  <li>What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?<br />quoting from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp">w3 article on string methods</a>
    <ul>
      <li>slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.</li>
      <li>substring() cannot accept negative indexes -- i.e. you can't slice from the back</li>
      <li>substr() is similar to slice(). The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are methods?<br />... maybe built in actions that do stuff to primitives?<br />oh! here it is from odin: a method is a bit of functionality that is built into the language or into specific data types</li>
  <li>What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
    <ul>
	  <li>OR: ||</li>
	  <li>AND: &&</li>
	  <li>NOT: !</li>
	  <li><small><i>and it appears there is a fourth...</i> Nullish Coalescing: ??</small></li>
	</ul>
	you can use && and || to give you one of multiple comparisons. AND returns the first falsy value while OR returns the first truthy one.<br />
	!! converts anything to its boolean. !! is the same as Boolean().<br />
	in order of precedence, ! then && then ||
  </li>
  <li>What are the comparison operators?
    <ul>
      <li>greater/less than: a > b / a < b</li>
      <li>greater/less than <i>or equals</i>: a >= b / a <= b</li>
      <li>equals: a == b<br />(nb: = is assignment, not the equality test)<br />== checks equality without checking types, whereas === checks for type first.</li>
      <li>not equals: a != b</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is nesting?</li>
  <li>What are truthy and falsy values?<br />truthy and falsy is just naming the inherent boolean value of various data</li>
  <li>What are the falsy values in JavaScript?<br />falsy:
    <ul>
	  <li>false</li>
	  <li>0</li>
	  <li>'' -- i.e. an empty string</li>
	  <li>null, undefined, or NaN</li>
	</ul>
	truthy (just for completeness, is basically anything else?):
	<ul>
	  <li>a non-empty string, e.g. '0' or 'false'</li>
	  <li>[] or {} or function(){}-- i.e. an empty array, an empty object, or an "empty" function</li>
	</ul>
</li>
  <li>What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?<br />if (condition) { code } else if (condition2) { code } else { code }</li>
  <li>What is the syntax for a switch statement?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between null and undefined?<br />null is something you assign when something is unknown, whereas undefined is sort of like null for default. they are both falsey.</li>
  <li>What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</li>
  <li>What are conditionals?<br ?> conditional statements let you make the computer pick a course of action based on a set of conditions.</li>
</ul>
